# javascript-30-challenge
Wes Bos's 30 day vanilla javascript coding challenge

I don't get the change to write much Javascript at work, so I decided to complete Wes Bos's javascript challenge to get back into the habit. I'm putting my completed challenges on Github to stay accountable for completing all 30 days.
